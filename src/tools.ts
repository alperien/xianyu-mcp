      'two listings at once': '`detail` reads two listing pages at a time, each on a page of its own, so the batch\'s wall clock falls while every listing\'s own latency rises -- measured at four wide: 27.1s of wall clock for 4 against 66.3s serially (2.4x, not 4x) with each listing\'s own latency going 11.4s -> 20.5s. That is why the shipped width is 2 (XIANYU_DETAIL_FANOUT, 0-4) and why every listing publishes its own `ms` and `via` in `detail_report`: the trade is reported, not asserted. The guard is the other half of that measurement: on a throttled site four-at-once answered 0/4 where the serial walk still answered 2/4, so the first fan-out batch that comes back with no answers turns the rest of the call serial and says so in `detail_fanout.fell_back`',
      'cold start': 'the session\'s first load is paid in the background at boot rather than on your first call; see cold_start_warm for whether it got there',

      'search pager walk': '30 listings a page at 5-9.5s each, against 13-25s for a fresh page load',
      'how many of a page match': 'varies a lot -- across three sessions `pages: 2` gave 25, 28 and 55 matches of 60 scanned, and `pages: 4` gave 81 of 90. Read `count`; do not assume 30 a page',
      'deep comparison, measured': '`pages: 2, limit: 50, detail: 50` returned 50 full listings, 39 fields and 247 photos, no failures, in 410s',
