/**
 * Every error this server raises on purpose. The class name is the published `error_type`, so
 * renaming one is a contract change rather than a refactor.
 *
 *   BrowserError             could not launch or drive the throwaway Chromium
 *   GatedError               goofish refused the call for this anonymous visitor
 *   ParseError               it loaded, but not in the shape we expected
 *   NavigationError          refused to navigate off goofish.com
 *   SearchUnavailableError   a GatedError: goofish declined this search on every attempt
 *   DetailUnavailableError   a GatedError: the item page would not render
 *
 * The last two are both GatedErrors and the split is the point: a search goofish declined and an
 * item page that will not paint are different facts, and a caller retries them differently.
 *
 * Anonymous search does work logged out, which is verified, but goofish decides per page load
 * whether to serve results. When it declines it never calls the search API at all -- the page
 * renders "nothing found" plus the 猜你喜欢 rail. So a declined search raises instead of returning
 * that rail, which would read as results and is not one.
