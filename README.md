# xianyu-mcp

[![ci](https://github.com/alperien/xianyu-mcp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alperien/xianyu-mcp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Read-only Xianyu (闲鱼 / Goofish) MCP server that needs no Xianyu account. No cookies, no login, no
stored credentials, no write tools.** TypeScript, run directly by Node — unflagged type stripping
landed in 23.6 and was backported to **22.18**, so that is the floor: on 22.6–22.17 `node src/index.ts`
and `node --test` both fail with `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` unless you add
`--experimental-strip-types`. A checkout runs straight from `src/`; `npm run build` emits `dist/` for
the published tarball, which is prebuilt because Node will not strip types from files under
`node_modules/`.

It drives its own throwaway Chromium with Playwright and reads goofish the way an anonymous visitor's
browser does — including calling goofish's own JS client (`window.lib.mtop.request`) rather than
re-implementing token minting and request signing, which is the whole reason a browser is involved.

It launches **windowed**, and needs a display (`DISPLAY=:0`, or Xvfb) — that is a measurement, not a
preference: [headless gets served goofish's risk-control page](#headless-vs-headed) instead of the app.
It never clicks anything in the page, and [the login dialog is deliberately left alone](#the-login-dialog-is-left-alone-on-purpose).

## Install

From a clone:

```bash
npm install                      # deps: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, zod
npx playwright install chromium  # or point XIANYU_BROWSER_PATH at a Chrome/Chromium binary
```

`playwright` is an *optional* dependency and is loaded the first time a browser is actually launched,
not at startup. That keeps it off the critical path: the server reaches MCP-ready in ~30ms instead of
paying ~4s for the import, and a tool call that never needs a Chromium never pays for one. If
playwright is missing entirely, the failure is a launch-time error naming the browser, not a
`MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at startup.

As a dependency (`npm install xianyu-mcp`), the published tarball is prebuilt — `dist/` — and
`npx playwright install chromium` is still needed. The build exists because Node refuses to strip
TypeScript types from files under `node_modules/`, so shipping `src/*.ts` would install fine and then
fail on first run.

Requires **Node 22.18+** (the server runs TypeScript directly, natively). It launches a windowed
Chromium, so it needs a display — on a headless box, `xvfb-run -a node src/index.ts` or an X server.
See [Headless vs headed](#headless-vs-headed) for what `XIANYU_HEADLESS=1` costs you.

## MCP client config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xianyu": { "command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/xianyu-mcp/dist/index.js"] }
  }
}
```

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `XIANYU_BROWSER_PATH` | Playwright's Chromium | use a specific Chrome/Chromium binary |
| `XIANYU_HEADLESS` | `0` (windowed) | `1` runs headless. Headed is the default because goofish serves headless Chromium its risk-control page instead of the app — see [Headless vs headed](#headless-vs-headed). Needs a display (`DISPLAY=:0`, or Xvfb). |
| `XIANYU_SEARCH_BUDGET_S` | 90 | wall-clock budget for the `search_items` retry loop (5–600s) |
| `XIANYU_ITEM_VIEW_BUDGET_S` | 90 | wall-clock budget for the `item_view` retry loop (5–600s) |
| `XIANYU_RECOMMENDATIONS_BUDGET_S` | 45 | wall-clock budget for the `recommendations` retry loop (5–600s) |

The budget bounds the *loop*, not the call. It is checked between attempts, so a page load already in
flight runs to completion: at the 90s default and a 10–25s load you get several attempts, and a call
can overshoot its budget by roughly one page load.

**The server runs windowed and needs a display.** goofish serves headless Chromium its risk-control
page instead of the app, which leaves the three DOM tools with nothing to read, so headed is the
default and a headless machine needs `xvfb-run` or an X server. The four mtop tools work either way.

## Tools

Every tool returns `{"ok": true, "data": …}` or `{"ok": false, "error_type": …, "message": …}`.
`error_type` is the class name, and the list is exhaustive: `BrowserError`, `GatedError`,
`SearchUnavailableError`, `DetailUnavailableError`, `ParseError`, `NavigationError` or `XianyuError`,
plus `Error` for a throw that is none of ours (a test pins the list against the classes in `errors.ts`). Calls are serialised —
one browser, one page — so two tools in flight cannot navigate each other out of their own data.

| Tool | Args | Key return fields |
|---|---|---|
| `capabilities` | — | `session_state` (`unexpectedly_logged_in` / `logged_out` / `unknown` — `logged_out` only from a ret that actually names the session or token, so a rate limit or a timeout reads `unknown` rather than proving anonymity), `feed_reachable`, `login_probe_ret`, `works_without_account`, `anonymous_flakiness`, `notes`, `note`, `browser_launches`, and a `browser_error` / `login_error` / `feed_error` per probe. Never raises, not even if the browser is gone. |
| `browse_feed` | `page_number` (1–10000, d1), `pages` (1–25, d1), `limit` (≤500, d60) | `items[]` of `rank, item_id, title, price, original_price, city, seller, want_count, image_count, image_urls, is_video, category_id, url`; `page_reports`, `raw_cards`, `unique_items`, `count`, `source: homepage_feed` |
| `search_count` | `query` | `match_count`, `has_matches`, `source: filter_hitnum`. Zero is an answer, not an error — but only when the site said zero: a `hitnum` that is missing, null, a string or carries a thousands separator is a `ParseError`, never `match_count: 0`. |
| `search_suggest` | `query`, `limit` (d20) | `suggestions[]` of `text, bucket_num`, `total_count`, `count`, `source: search_suggest` |
| `search_items` | `query`, `limit` (d60), `attempts` (1–10, d4), **`pages`** (1–10, d1), **`detail`** (0–50, d0) | `items[]` of matches only, each with price, want_count, city, seller, seller_avatar, tags, image_urls and rank — and, for the `detail` top N, the full listing: description, every photo, browse_count, collect_count, brand, condition, used_years, attributes, item_status, and the seller with city, tenure, sales, rating, reply rate, signature and 芝麻 status. `count` (matches), `pages_fetched`, `scraped_cards`, `query_hits` (whole query as a phrase), `token_hits` (every term, any order — the looser rule that makes Chinese work), `matched_by`, `min_query_hits`, `non_matching_count`, `detail_requested` / `detailed` / `detail_ms` / `detail_report` (per-listing: which answered, from where, and what goofish said when it did not), `attempt_log`, `source: search_api`. Raises `SearchUnavailableError` rather than returning the rail. |
| `related_items` | `item_id` (optional), `limit` (d30), `page` (1–10000, d1) | `items[]` (feed card shape), `raw_cards`, `unique_items`, `has_more`, `source: item_web_recommend` |
| `item_view` | `item_id` (digits or item URL) | `title, price, want_count, browse_count, description, seller, seller_tenure_years, seller_items_sold, seller_positive_rate, image_urls`, plus `seller_city, seller_signature, seller_reply_rate_24h, seller_items_listed, seller_avatar, seller_zhima_verified, brand, condition, used_years, attributes, collect_count, quantity, item_status, shipping_fee`, `fields_present` / `fields_missing`, `page_item_id`, and `source`: **`item_detail_api`** (the full listing), **`item_page_dom`** (the rendered page) or **`search_card_cache`** (an earlier search result in this session — see [item_view](#item_view-reads-the-calls-the-page-makes)) |
| `recommendations` | `limit` (d30), `url` (optional) | `items[]`, `rail`, `page_url`, `attempts`, `risk_control_page`, `count`, `source: dom_recommendation` — or `source: homepage_feed` with `fallback_reason` when the DOM will not render |

## The login dialog is left alone, on purpose

goofish puts a full-page login dialog in front of anonymous visitors: an `ant-modal-mask` (z-index 1000)
and an `alibaba-login-box` passport iframe. **It does not gate anything, and closing it is not what makes
search work.** This server used to claim the opposite — "it must be closed or the page renders zero
cards" — and to click its close controls after every navigation. That was backwards, and it made
`search_items` decline on essentially every attempt.

An A/B, headed, same URL, one fresh context per arm:

| arm | t+6s | t+12s | t+18s | t+24s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| no dismissal | 0 cards | **30 cards**, real X220 matches (`联想ThinkPad X220，12.5寸黑色…`) | 30 | 30 |
| dismiss at t+6s | 0 | 0 (4 elements clicked) | 0 | 0 |
| dismiss at t+12s | 0 | 0 | 0 (4 clicked) | 0 |

The cards are in the DOM *underneath* the mask the whole time; clicking the close controls put the page
into a state where the result list never rendered and the 猜你喜欢 rail was served instead.

So nothing here clicks the page at all. Both scrapers work off `querySelectorAll` and `innerText`, which
see straight through an overlay — measured directly: on an item page the `为你推荐` rail rendered and was
read with `ant-modal-mask` still up, and `bottomLead` — the fixed full-width "登录后可以更懂你…
立即登录" bar at z-index 999 — was up in the same samples without changing the card count. It sits at the
bottom of the viewport and would cover the last row for a real user clicking around; it covers nothing
that is read. A test pins this: a search page with the dialog and four clickable close controls wired to
a tripwire still returns its matches, and the tripwire has to stay quiet.

A real logged-out user does see a first popup at ~7s, a second one later, and reports that closing them
makes results appear. That is a real-browser-profile observation and this code is not it, so it is
recorded and not designed around. The one thing measured here is that the click, on this client, is
harmful.

## Search is a keystroke, not a URL

`search_items` does not navigate to `/search?q=`. It loads goofish's **homepage**, finds the SPA's own
header search input, focuses it, types the query and presses Enter — and the results it returns are the
search call the page makes for itself, read off the wire. That call cannot be re-issued by this server:
`mtop.taobao.idlemtopsearch.pc.search`, with the payload the page itself sent, answers
`TIMEOUT::接口超时` when it is, for the same reason item detail does (see
[item_view](#item_view-reads-the-calls-the-page-makes)). Letting the page ask is the only route, and
it is the richer one: 30 structured results per query, each with a price, a want count, a city and a
photo, where the DOM card this used to scrape could see a title and little else.

This is measured, not preferred. A 2x2x2 matrix — headed/headless x fresh/persistent profile x
direct-URL/search-input, one fresh browser per cell — returned results from exactly one cell:

| cell | cards | cards whose titles contain the query | outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| headed, fresh, **typed into the input** | 30 | 30 | results |
| headed, fresh, `/search?q=` | 20 | 0 | 猜你喜欢 rail |
| every direct-URL cell, headed included | 20 | 0 | 猜你喜欢 rail |
| headless, all cells | 20 | 0 | risk-control page |

So a direct-URL search on this client returns the recommendation rail, not results, and no amount of
retrying fixes it. The first three attempts type; the last is the one direct-URL navigation, kept so a
refusal can quote a real page rather than a guess — it is expected to be refused, and is reported as
what it is.

### Depth: `pages` and `detail`

One search reply is 30 listings, and the search API cannot be re-issued — replaying the page's own
payload through the same client answers `TIMEOUT::接口超时`, for the same anti-bot reason item detail
does. Scrolling the results page does not paginate. So the only way past 30 is the page's own pager,
which this server clicks: a DOM `click()`, not a Playwright pointer click, so the login dialog's
`ant-modal-mask` cannot intercept it the way it eats every other click here. It is the search page's
own pagination control, not a dialog dismissal.

Measured: **30 new listings per page, 5–9.5s, zero overlap**, against 13–25s for a fresh page load.

**How many of a page's 30 actually match is not 30.** goofish's ranking drifts between requests, so
across three separate sessions `pages: 2` gave **25, 28 and 55** matches of 60 scanned, and a page
three sometimes returned items already seen on pages one and two. `pages` is therefore a floor, not a
ceiling: if the pages it walked leave fewer than `limit` matches, up to two more are walked. That bounds
a thin market at about 14s extra rather than letting a degraded page silently under-deliver — and
`pages_fetched` and `count` are both in the envelope, so what you actually got is never a guess.

| | scanned | matches | time |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pages: 1` | 30 | 24–26 | 27s |
| `pages: 2` | 60 | 25 / 28 / 55 | 21–36s |
| `pages: 4` | 90 | **81–82** | 19–36s |

`detail: N` reads the top N of the ranked results in full — description, every photo, and the seller
with their city, tenure, sales count, rating, reply rate, signature and 芝麻 status. It is **one page
load per listing — measured **7.5s and 10.1s** on the same box at different loads — and it does not
parallelise**: four browser tabs loading four item pages at once measured 8.2s per listing against
~9s serially, because goofish throttles per IP. Concurrency buys nothing and only risks more
declines, so it is walked serially. Budget for 6–9 minutes on 50.

**`search_items("thinkpad x220", pages: 2, limit: 50, detail: 50)`, measured:**

| | |
|---|---|
| 50 listings, **50 read in full, 0 failures** | 410s and 548s on two runs (374s / 506s of it detail) |
| 39 fields per listing, 50 descriptions | 45–46 of 50 with a seller rating on file |
| 246–247 photos, price ¥80–¥499.9, median ¥228–248 | 104–108 KB of JSON, the token cost |

The card fields are the reason `detail` is optional. Every listing in the reply already has a price, a
want count, a city, the seller, their avatar, a photo and the tag strip (free shipping, price drop,
seller credit) — all free, because it is in the reply we already had. The seller was the visible gap:
a search card's name is `exContent.userNickName`, and reading `userNick` — which does not exist on a
search card — left every search result with an empty seller. So ask for `detail` only on the shortlist
you want in depth, not on all fifty.

`detail_report` is published for exactly this reason: it names every listing by id, whether it
answered, from which route, and what goofish said when it did not. A listing that will not answer
falls back to the search card rather than being dropped, and says so in `detail_source` — a shorter
list is fine, a dishonest one is not.

**A query matches by its terms, in any order — this is not a detail.** goofish titles are in whatever
word order the seller typed, and Chinese has no spaces to learn word boundaries from, so an exact
substring test rejects nearly everything on this site. Measured, before this was fixed: a search for
`机械硬盘4t` — 70,146 listings by goofish's own counter — returned *nothing*, because the titles say
`西数4T机械硬盘`; `i350网卡` failed because titles say `Intel i350 网卡`. The query is split at
whitespace and at every CJK↔Latin boundary (with a bare number and its unit kept together, so
`显示器24寸` is `显示器` + `24寸`), and a listing matches when its title carries *all* of the terms in
any order. The rail is still refused: a page full of bicycles does not contain `机械硬盘` and `4t`
together. `matched_by` reports `phrase` when the strict and loose rules agreed and `all_terms` when
the loose one admitted the set on its own.

**Only the first search of a session pays for a page load.** If the dom page is already showing
results, the next query is typed into the header input *there* — an SPA route change, measured 13–15s
against 21s for a cold load. The input is selected-and-retyped rather than appended to, because on a
warm page it still holds the previous query and `thinkpad x220` + `ipad air` submits as one nonsense
keyword that legitimately finds nothing. That was a real bug the warm path introduced, and the
relevance guard is what surfaced it rather than a plausible-looking result set.

**The input is focused, not clicked.** goofish's login dialog puts an `ant-modal-mask` over the header,
and Playwright's click actionability check times out against it (measured: a 10s timeout with the element
resolved but never receiving the event). `focus()` needs no pointer, and the keystrokes that follow are
what the SPA's form listens for.

**Typing is verified, not assumed.** The SPA re-renders that input under the cursor, and a
`keyboard.type` burst spanning a re-render is silently truncated — measured, `thinkpad x220` landing as
`th`, which then submitted a near-empty keyword and served the rail. The input is read back after
typing and whatever did not land is re-sent; a query that still will not take is reported as
`incomplete-keystrokes` rather than as a decline.

The homepage is a 512-character footer-only shell for 8–14s before the app mounts, so "no input yet" is
the normal state for the first ten seconds and is polled, not treated as a verdict. After Enter the
router needs ~12s, and the SPA destroys the execution context on the way — a lost context is waited out,
because it is the navigation landing rather than a failure.

## Headless vs headed

Measured, same URL, one fresh context per run, sampling every 4s for 128–200s:

| | headed | headless |
|---|---|---|
| what goofish serves | the app: filter bar, suggest rail, login dialog, 20 cards, 2.3KB | the risk-control page: `非法访问 为了保障您的体验，请使用正常浏览器访问闲鱼~`, 0 cards, **35 bytes**, for the entire run |
| `mtop` client | up | **up** — it boots on the risk-control page too |
| DOM tools | get the real page | get nothing to read |

So **headed is the default** and the three DOM tools need a display. What headless can still do is
everything that only needs goofish's own JS client — `browse_feed`, `search_count`, `search_suggest`,
`related_items`, and the probes inside `capabilities` — because the mtop client comes up on the
risk-control page as well. That was measured: all four returned normal data headless.

Set `XIANYU_HEADLESS=1` to opt back in; the cost is the DOM tools.

## Latency

Measured live on 2026-09-29, headed, on a shared 4-core box at load ~12 (one goofish page load is
10–25s here, Chromium launch is ~5s). One process, one browser: the first row is the cold start, every
other figure is that same warm session. Treat these as order of magnitude, not a benchmark.

| tool | warm | result |
|---|---|---|
| cold start (launch + first feed) | 24.7s | — |
| `capabilities` | 1.9s | `logged_out`, `feed_reachable: true` |
| `search_count` | 0.5s | 28,8xx for `thinkpad x220` |
| `search_suggest` | 0.4s | 10 suggestions |
| `related_items` | 2.2s | 20 listings, `item_web_recommend` |
| `browse_feed` | 1.5s | 20 listings, `homepage_feed` |
| `search_items` — first of a session | 20.9s | 10 matches, `search_api` |
| `search_items` — later, warm page | 13.6–14.9s | 10 matches, `search_api` |
| `item_view` | 6.4–9.5s | 5/5 live listings, `item_detail_api`, `fields_missing: []` |
| `recommendations` | 17.7s | 20 real listings, `dom_recommendation` |

Two things do the work. The four mtop-only tools run on a page of their own that never navigates, so
they cost one request and no page load — 0.4–2.2s warm — and they no longer queue behind a search. And
only the *first* `search_items` of a session pays for a page load: later ones retype into the header
input of the page already showing results, which is an SPA route change, 13–15s against 21s for a cold
load. `item_view` reads the call the page makes for itself, which is both the only route that works and
far cheaper than the reload-and-retry loop it replaced.

The budget bounds the *loop*, not the call. It is checked between attempts, so a page load already in
flight runs to completion: at the 90s default and a 10–25s load you get several attempts, and a call
can overshoot its budget by roughly one page load. At that default `attempts: 4` is reachable without
raising anything. Note that raising the budget alone does not help when the site is declining every
load: a 280s budget with the default 4 attempts still stopped at 90s on the attempt cap, and 200s of
continuous polling on one page load never produced a result.

**The server runs windowed and needs a display.** goofish serves headless Chromium its risk-control
page instead of the app, which leaves the three DOM tools with nothing to read, so headed is the
default and a headless machine needs `xvfb-run` or an X server. The four mtop tools work either way.

## What is verified, and what is not

**Verified against the live site, on 2026-09-29.** The mtop endpoints behind `browse_feed`,
`search_count`, `search_suggest` and `related_items` all answer anonymously, in *both* headless and
headed: 8 feed pages / 157 unique listings with 0 duplicates, the match counter at 28,841 and 29,671
for `x220` on consecutive runs (it drifts, so treat the number as a magnitude, not a constant) and 0 for
a nonsense string, autocomplete turning `x220` into `x220笔记本` / `x220键盘` / …, and ~30–60 real
listings per recommendation call. The four raw mtop rets were read directly off the wire:
`SUCCESS::调用成功` for the feed (20 cards), the counter, the suggest list and the recommendation list,
and `FAIL_SYS_SESSION_EXPIRED::Session过期` for `loginuser.get` — so the session really is logged out.
`recommendations` also worked end-to-end off the rendered DOM, 10 real listings, `source:
dom_recommendation`, in both modes, with the login dialog up — on three of four runs; the fourth fell
back to `source: homepage_feed` with a `fallback_reason`, which is the designed behaviour when the rail
will not paint, and is live listings either way. The MCP server itself was driven over
stdio: `initialize`, `tools/list` returning all eight with their schemas and the no-account note on each,
and a live `search_count` returning `{"ok":true,...,"match_count":28846}`.

### `item_view` reads the calls the page makes

goofish does not serve item detail to a request *this server* makes. Its own detail call,
`mtop.taobao.idle.pc.detail`, answers `TIMEOUT::接口超时` when re-issued through the page's mtop client
with the payload the page itself sent — goofish stamps the requests its own bundle originates with a
per-call anti-bot blob, and a request we synthesise does not carry it. The same API, called by the page,
answers `SUCCESS::调用成功` and carries the listing.

So `item_view` loads the item page and reads the reply that page makes for itself, off the wire. That
is the only route that works, and it is also the richer one: the reply holds the title, the full photo
gallery, the description, the 品牌/成色/已用年限 attribute block, the seller's city, tenure, sales
count, positive rate, signature, reply rate and avatar, plus favourites, quantity and shipping.

This replaces a premise this README used to state, in three comments in the source and in the tool
description: that "goofish does not serve item pages to logged-out visitors". It does. Measured on
2026-09-29: the detail block paints, the API answers anonymously, and 6/6 live listings returned in
4–10s. The DOM path the tool fell back to is the thing that was actually broken — it could not produce
a title at all (empty on 6 of 6 live listings, because the title is not in the page's text; it is in
the document title), and its photo selector returned goofish's own promo banners, four `-tps-242-150.png`
strips on a page whose listing was a nail gun.

| | when | what you get |
|---|---|---|
| `source: item_detail_api` | the page's detail call answered | everything listed above, exact |
| `source: item_page_dom` | no API reply, but the detail block rendered | the ten DOM-scrapable fields, title included |
| `source: search_card_cache` | the page would not answer, but an earlier search in this session returned the id | title, price, city, want count, photo — and `fields_missing` naming the description and the seller statistics |

The card route is keyed on `item_id`, not on a query, so it cannot return a similarly-named listing.
It is the *last* resort rather than the first, now that the page itself is fast; it replaced a fallback
that ran up to eight whole keyword searches, each a fresh 10–25s page load.

If none of them find it, the error quotes what goofish actually said — most often that this id is
sold, removed, or too old to still be live, since goofish answers a dead id with no listing rather than
an error. It does not tell you to look for a throttled IP, which is what an earlier version of this
README did and what was wrong.

**Still worth knowing about the site.** goofish decides *per page load* whether to serve a given page,
and an automated client is served a risk-control notice (`非法访问 / 请使用正常浏览器访问闲鱼`) more often
than a real browser is. That page is a 200 that renders no listing at all; the four mtop tools keep
working through it because they need only the client. When it happens the DOM tools say `blocked: true`
rather than reporting zero results. Its own edge also fails outright sometimes, serving a `网络不见了`
page — named as `site_error`, and retried rather than waited on.

## Guarantees, enforced by tests

- **No account, ever.** A brand-new browser context per session. `loginuser.get` is called only to
  *prove* the session is logged out, never to act as one, and `capabilities` reports `session_state`
  from what that probe actually returned — not from the fact that it failed.
- **No credentials.** No cookie, storage-state or persistent-profile API appears anywhere in `src/`
  or `test/`; the test that enforces it matches `.cookies(` with whitespace stripped, so
  `page.context().cookies()` and a call split across lines cannot slip through either.
- **No orphaned browsers.** The server holds a real windowed Chromium, so shutdown is deliberate: a
client closing stdin, a signal, and an unexpected exit all route through one bounded teardown, and a
`browser.close()` that hangs is SIGKILLed rather than left running. Two measured defects are behind
that guarantee, and both were invisible from inside the process. The SDK's stdio transport does not
listen for the end of stdin, so a client that simply went away left the server running indefinitely.
And closing stdin emits *both* `end` and `close`, so the second one hit the re-entrancy guard and
called `process.exit` while the teardown was still in flight — the node process died mid-`close()` and
left the browser reparented to init: **15 orphaned processes after one audit run**. The guard now lets
the in-flight teardown finish, and a `process.on('exit')` hook SIGKILLs the browser synchronously for
the path where the event loop has already stopped. Verified after every fix: 0 processes left, 0 orphans.
- **Read-only.** No publish, delete, message, upload or account tool exists. The seven mtop API names
  the server may use are a closed list — only `window.lib.mtop.request`, the client method the whole
  design rests on, is exempt — and a test fails if any other `mtop.*` name appears. Five are called by
  this server; the other two (`idle.pc.detail`, `idlemtopsearch.pc.search`) are named because the *page*
  calls them and the server reads the replies — see [item_view](#item_view-reads-the-calls-the-page-makes).
- **goofish only, over https.** Every navigation passes a host *and* scheme allowlist checked against
  the *parsed* URL, and re-checked against the URL goofish itself landed on, at both `goto` sites and in
  `revive`. Those checks are point-in-time, and a caller then polls for seconds before it reads
  anything, so every DOM read also re-checks the URL that is live *now*, in the same statement as the
  read — one helper, and no scraper may bypass it (a test fails the build if one does).
  `https://www.goofish.com@evil.com/`, `https://www.goofish.computer/` and
  `https://www.goofish.com.evil.com/` are all refused, including when the page lands on one of them
  mid-call.
- **No invented data.** If a page will not render, the tool raises rather than guessing. If goofish
  serves a different listing than the one asked for — or a page with no listing id at all —
  `item_view` raises instead of reporting its fields. The recommendation rail is never returned as
  search results.
- **The page is never clicked.** A structural test fails if a `.click(` call appears anywhere in
  `src/` or `test/`, and if the dismisser's selectors come back.
- **One version, written once.** The version in the MCP handshake is read out of `package.json` at
  startup, and a test fails if a semver literal reappears anywhere in `src/`. It used to be written
  down in both places, so `npm version` could bump the package while every client was still told the
  previous release existed.

## Development

```bash
npm test                 # 59 tests, no network, no browser
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit over src and test
npm run build            # src/*.ts -> dist/*.js, what the tarball ships
node src/index.ts        # stdio, run from source; refuses to run interactively
```

`tsconfig.json` is `noEmit` on purpose — the source runs directly under Node's type stripping, so a
clone needs no build step. `tsconfig.build.json` is the emit config for the published artifact, and the
two differ only in that. Any import in `src/` keeps its `.ts` extension and `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`
turns it into a `.js` one at build time; do not hand-write `.js` imports.
